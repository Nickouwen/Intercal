## Project Description:
Our Group goal with this prject was to help make a useful research tool for people looking into water levels in canadian lakes and rivers. By using evironment Canada's data, and creating a tool to visualize data, and track lake performance in real time and flag potential issues with lake levels.

## User Groups:
### Researchers:
Researchers can locate water levels and data visualizations that show trends in the water levels over a period of time. This can help with analysis of water flows for any region in Canada, and will lend itself to a researcher's tool set for statistical analysis and visualization

### Curious Individuals
This tool will allow anybody who is curious about understanding water levels in their area to view the trends on the app; This way they can make informed decisions regarding possible seasonal patterns, flooding, discharge, etc.

## Final list of requirements:

### User Requirements:
#### Regular User:
 - Search for lakes based on ID or station name
 - View lake data, statistics and visualizations
 - View lake predictions
 - Add lakes to bookmark bar
 - Create accounts
 - Filter lakes based on station parameters
#### Admin:
 - Flag lakes for alerts
### System Requirements:
#### Functional Requirements:
 - Query the database for lakes with specific ID's or names
 - Display current lake data within a dashboard
 - Display lake levels in a data visualization
 - Link lakes to a user's dashboard via bookmarks sidebar
 - Allow admin to assign alerts to lakes out of acceptable values within a database
 - Add users to ddatabases according to their input
 - Filter lakes based on their parameters
 - The system must query water level data from government API
#### Non-Functional Requirements:
 - Predictuons must be processed on client-side
 - Data visualization client-side
 - Maintain flagged lakes and monitoring posts
 - Store users and bookmarked lakes on server
 - Respond to queries in a reasonable amount of time
 - Link to sourced data to openly display facts
### User Stories:
 - As a user, I want to get visualizations for lake data so that I can gain an understanding of water annual water flows in a given area
 - As a admin, I want to flag issues with lakes I come across.
 - As a admin, I want the system to show lakes with potential issues
 - As a user, I want to be able to sign into an account
 - As a user, I want a to be able to filter lakes based on names, lakes, or water levels
 - As a user, I want to be able to save certain lakes to my dashboard for convenient analysis
 - As a user, I want to be able to manage my personal dashboard in order to edit or remove certain elements
 - As a user, I want to see a forecast for what the lake data will look like.
